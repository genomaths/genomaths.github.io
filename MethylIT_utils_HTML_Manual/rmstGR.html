<h2>Root Mean Square Test for metadata in a list of GRanges objects</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Count data in <a href='https://genomaths.github.io//MethylIT_utils_HTML_Manual/MethylIT_utils_Manual.html'>MethylIT.utils</a> pipeline is carried in GRanges objects.
This function provides a shortcut to apply the parametric Bootstrap
of 2x2 Contingency independence test, which is implemented in function
<code>bootstrap2x2</code>. The  goodness of fit statistic is
the root-mean-square statistic (RMST) or Hellinger divergence, as
proposed by Perkins et al. [1, 2]. Hellinger divergence (HD) is computed
as proposed in [3].
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
rmstGR(LR, count.col = 1:2, control.names = NULL,
  treatment.names = NULL, stat = "rmst", pooling.stat = "sum",
  tv.cut = NULL, hdiv.cut = NULL, hdiv.col = NULL,
  num.permut = 100, pAdjustMethod = "BH", pvalCutOff = 0.05,
  saveAll = FALSE, num.cores = 1L, tasks = 0L, verbose = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>LR</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of GRanges, a GRangesList, a CompressedGRangesList object.
Each GRanges object from the list must have two columns: methylated
(mC) and unmethylated (uC) counts. The name of each element from the
list must coincide with a control or a treatment name.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>count.col</code></td>
<td>
<p>2d-vector of integers with the indexes of the read count
columns. If not given, then it is asssumed that the methylated and
unmethylated read counts are located in columns 1 and 2 of each GRanges
metacolumns. If object LR is the output of Methyl-IT function
<code>estimateDivergence</code>, then columns 1:4 are the read
count columns: columns 1 and 2 are methylated and unmethylated read
counts from the reference group, while columns 3 and 4 are methylated and
unmethylated read counts from the treatment group, respectively. In this
case, if the requested comparison is reference versus treatment, then no
specification is needed for count.col. The comparison control versus
treatment can be obtained by setting count.col = 3:4 and providing
control.names and treatment.names.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>control.names, treatment.names</code></td>
<td>
<p>Names/IDs of the control samples, which
must be included in the variable GR at the metacolumn. Default is NULL.
If NULL, then it is assumed that each GRanges object in LR has four
columns of counts. The first two columns correspond to the methylated and
unmethylated counts from control/reference and the other two columns are
the methylated and unmethylated counts from treatment, respectively.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>stat</code></td>
<td>
<p>Statistic to be used in the testing: 'rmst' (root mean square
test) or 'hdiv' (Hellinger divergence test).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pooling.stat</code></td>
<td>
<p>statistic used to estimate the methylation pool: row sum,
row mean or row median of methylated and unmethylated read counts across
individuals. If the number of control samples is greater than 2 and
pooling.stat is not NULL, then they will pooled. The same for treatment.
Otherwise, all the pairwise comparisons will be done.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tv.cut</code></td>
<td>
<p>A cutoff for the total variation distance (TVD; absolute value
of methylation levels differences) estimated at each site/range as the
difference of the group means of methylation levels. If tv.cut is
provided, then sites/ranges k with abs(TV_k) &lt; tv.cut are removed before
to perform the regression analysis. Its value must be NULL or a number
0 &lt; tv.cut &lt; 1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>hdiv.cut</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional cutoff for the Hellinger divergence (*hdiv*). If
the LR object derives from the previous application of function
<code>estimateDivergence</code>, then a column with the *hdiv* values is
provided. If combined with tv.cut, this permits a more effective
filtering of the signal from the noise. Default is NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>hdiv.col</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional. Columns where *hdiv* values are located in each
GRange object from LR. It must be provided if together with *hdiv.cut*.
Default is NULL.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num.permut</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of permutations.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pAdjustMethod</code></td>
<td>
<p>method used to adjust the results; default: BH</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pvalCutOff</code></td>
<td>
<p>cutoff used when a p-value adjustment is performed</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>saveAll</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE all the temporal results are returned</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num.cores, tasks</code></td>
<td>
<p>Paramaters for parallele computation using package
<code>BiocParallel-package</code>: the number of cores to
use, i.e. at most how many child processes will be run simultaneously
(see <code>bplapply</code> and the number of tasks per job
(only for Linux OS).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, prints the function log to stdout</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional parameters for function
<code><a href='https://genomaths.github.io//MethylIT_utils_HTML_Manual/MethylIT_utils_Manual.html'>MethylIT.utils</a></code>.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Samples from each group are pooled according to the statistic
selected (see parameter pooling.stat) and a unique GRanges object is
created with the methylated and unmethylated read counts for each group
(control and treatment) in the metacolumn. So, a contingency table can be
built for range from GRanges object.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A GRanges object with the original sample counts, bootstrap p-value
probability, total variation (difference of methylation levels), and
p-value adjusment.
