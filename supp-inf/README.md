# _Segregation of an MSH1 RNAi transgene produces heritable non-genetic memory in association with methylome reprogramming_

The data set in the file "_mm_nm_wt_transgen_meth_density_and_gene-exp_at_genes_06-01-19.RData_" carries the information on
the density of methylation levels and gene expression on methylomes of msh1-memory line (first generation).

These data are used in the vignette entitled: _Association Between Gene Expression and Cytosine DNA Methylation at gene-body_
available at MethylIT website https://genomaths.github.io/methylit/, which is provided as Supplementary Information for the manuscript: _"Segregation of an MSH1 RNAi transgene produces heritable non-genetic memory in
association with methylome reprogramming"_ (currently in Press).
