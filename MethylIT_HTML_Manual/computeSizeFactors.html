<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A comment about size factor estimation by DEseq based on Simon
Anders (Heidelberg, Germany) work to estimate the library size, simply
taking the total number of (mapped or unmapped) reads is, in our
experience, not a good idea. Sometimes, a few very strongly expressed
genes are differentially expressed, and as they make up a good part of
the total counts, they skew this number. After you divide by total
counts, these few strongly expressed genes become equal, and the whole
rest looks differentially expressed.
</p>
<p>The following simple alternative works much better: - Construct a
&quot;reference sample&quot; by taking, for each gene, the geometric mean of the
counts in all samples. - To get the sequencing depth of a sample
relative to the reference, calculate for each gene the quotient of the
counts in your sample divided by the counts of the reference sample. Now
you have, for each gene, an estimate of the depth ratio. - Simply take
the median of all the quotients to get the relative depth of the
library. This is what the 'estimateSizeFactors' function of our DESeq
package does.
