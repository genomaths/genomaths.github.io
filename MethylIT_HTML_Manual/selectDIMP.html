<h2>Selection of DIMPs</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>For a given cutpoint (previously estimated with the function
estimateCutPoint), 'selectDIMP' will return the differentially
informative methyated positions (DIMPs). DIMPs are cytosine positions for
which the divergence is greater than the cutpoint.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
selectDIMP(LR, div.col = NULL, pval.col = NULL, absolute = FALSE,
  cutpoint, tv.col = NULL, tv.cut = NULL)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>LR</code></td>
<td>
<p>A list of GRanges objects including control and treatment GRanges.
Each GRanges object must correspond to a sample. For example, if a
sample is named 's1', then this sample can be accessed in the list of
GRanges objects as LR$s1.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>div.col</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of the column where the divergence variable (i.e.,
Hellinger divergence) is located in the GRanges meta-columns.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>pval.col</code></td>
<td>
<p>If the cutpoints is a p-value, then the column number for
p-values should be provided. Default: NULL. Notice that one of the
parameter values div.col or pval.col must be given.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>absolute</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logic (default, FALSE). Total variation (TV, the difference
of methylation levels) is normally an output in the downstream MethylIT
analysis. If 'absolute = TRUE', then TV is tranformed into |TV|, which is
an information divergence that can be fitted to Weibull or to Generalized
Gamma distribution. So, if the nonlinear fit was performed for |TV|, then
here absolute must be set to TRUE.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>cutpoint</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cutpoint to select DIMPs. Cytosine positions with divergence
greater than 'cutpoint' will selected as DIMPs. Cutpoints are estimated
with the function 'estimateCutPoint'.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tv.col</code></td>
<td>
<p>Column number for the total variation to be used for filtering
cytosine positions (if provided).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tv.cut</code></td>
<td>
<p>If tv.cut and tv.col are provided, then cytosine sites k with
abs(TV_k) &lt; tv.cut are removed.</p>
</td></tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Theoretically a DIMP denotes a cytosine position with high
probability to be differentially methylated. That is, in the statistical
molecular-biophysics context, a DIMP must be considered only in a
probabilistic term and not as an absolute deterministic experimental
output.
</p>
<p>The uncertainty and dynamics of the DNA methylation process, the
continuous action of the omnipresent thermal fluctuations, as well as,
the inherent stochasticity of the biochemical reactions make it
impossible to ensure whether a specific cytosine position is methylated
in an absolutely deterministic sense. Notice that the concept of DIMP is
not applicable to a single cell (if we use an instrumentation/protocol
to directly measure methylation at the molecular level, and not via PCR),
since a concrete, single DNA cytosine position in a single cell is
methylated or not methylated.
</p>
<p>However, when pooling DNA extracted from a tissue, the previous
reasonings about uncertainty hold plus an additional uncertainty factor:
cells from the same tissue are not synchronized but are found in
different stages of their ontogenetic developments. Hence, the DIMP
concept holds in the mentioned circumstances where the uncertainty of
methylation is present.

position (DIMPs).
