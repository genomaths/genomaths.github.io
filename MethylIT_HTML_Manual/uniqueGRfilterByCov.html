<h2>Unique GRanges of methylation read counts filtered by coverages</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Given two GRanges objects, this function will filter by coverage
each cytosine site from each GRanges object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
uniqueGRfilterByCov(x, y, min.coverage = 4, percentile = 0.9999,
  high.coverage = NULL, columns = c(mC = 1, uC = 2), num.cores = 1L,
  tasks = 0L, verbose = TRUE, ...)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A GRanges object with methylated and unmethylated counts in its
meta-column.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>y</code></td>
<td>
<p>A GRanges object with methylated and unmethylated counts in its
meta-column.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>min.coverage</code></td>
<td>
<p>Cytosine sites with coverage less than min.coverage are
discarded.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>percentile</code></td>
<td>
<p>Threshold to remove the outliers from each file and all
files stacked.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>high.coverage</code></td>
<td>
<p>An integer for read counts. Cytosine sites having higher
coverage than this are discarded.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>columns</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vector of integer numbers of the columns (from each GRanges
meta-column) where the methylated and unmethylated counts are provided. If
not provided, then the methylated and unmethylated counts are assumed to
be at columns 1 and 2, respectively.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>num.cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of cores to use, i.e. at most how many child
processes will be run simultaneously (see bplapply function from
BiocParallel package).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>tasks</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer(1). The number of tasks per job. value must be a scalar
integer &gt;= 0L. In this documentation a job is defined as a single call to a
function, such as bplapply, bpmapply etc. A task is the division of the X
argument into chunks. When tasks == 0 (default), X is divided as evenly as
possible over the number of workers (see MulticoreParam from BiocParallel
package).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, prints the function log to stdout</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Additional parameters for 'uniqueGRanges' function.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Cytosine sites with 'coverage' &gt; 'min.coverage' and 'coverage' &lt;
'percentile' (e.g., 99.9 percentile) in at least one of the samples are
preserved. It is expected that the columns of methylated and unmethylated
counts are given.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A GRanges object with the columns of methylated and unmethylated
counts filtered for each cytosine position.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
dfChr1 &lt;- data.frame(chr = "chr1", start = 11:15, end = 11:15,
strand &lt;- c("+","-","+","*","."), mC = 1:5, uC = 1:5)
dfChr2 &lt;- data.frame(chr = "chr1", start = 12:18, end = 12:18,
strand &lt;- '*', mC = 1:7, uC = 1:7)
gr1 &lt;- makeGRangesFromDataFrame(dfChr1, keep.extra.columns = TRUE)
gr2 &lt;- makeGRangesFromDataFrame(dfChr2, keep.extra.columns = TRUE)
r1 &lt;- uniqueGRfilterByCov(gr1, gr2, ignore.strand = TRUE)
