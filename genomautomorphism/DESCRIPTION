Description: 
            This is a R package to compute the automorphisms between pairwise 
            aligned DNA sequences represented as elements from a Genomic 
            Abelian group. In a general scenario, from genomic regions till 
            the whole genomes from a given population (from any species or 
            close related species) can be algebraically represented as a 
            direct sum of cyclic groups or more specifically Abelian p-groups. 
            Basically, we propose the representation of multiple sequence 
            alignments of length N bp as element of a finite Abelian group 
            created by the direct sum of homocyclic Abelian group of 
            prime-power order.
