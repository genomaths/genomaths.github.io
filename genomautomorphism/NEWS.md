# GenomAutomorphism 1.5.1

* Introducing new functions for DNA and aminoacid sequence representations
  with physicochemical properties of DNA and aminoacids, which would be 
  useful for further downstream statistical analysis in R.

# GenomAutomorphism 1.0.2

* Fix error of parallel computation on Windows (12/08/2022)

# GenomAutomorphism 1.0.1

* Expanding analyses by including aminoacid similarity based on codon
  distances. Three new functions are added: codon_dist, codon_dist_matrix,
  and aminoacid_dist. See a tutorial applying these functions at 
  https://is.gd/oYLDK4.

# GenomAutomorphism 1.0.0

* Release in Bioconductor (version 3.16). 
  https://doi.org/doi:10.18129/B9.bioc.GenomAutomorphism

# GenomAutomorphism 0.99.4

* Expanding analyses by including amino acid similarity and statistical 
  protein contact potentials matrices from from Amino Acid Index Database 
  https://www.genome.jp/aaindex/.
* Improving documentation.
* Fixed a bug which introduced a change of protein coding frameshift.

# GenomAutomorphism 0.99.3

* Documentation improvement.      
* Package accepted on Bioconductor (07/18/22)
