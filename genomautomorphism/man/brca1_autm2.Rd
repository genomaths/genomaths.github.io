\title{Automorphisms between DNA Sequences from Primate BRCA1 Genes}
\format{
\code{\link{AutomorphismList}} class object.
}
\usage{
brca1_autm2
}
\description{
This is a \code{\link{AutomorphismList}} object carrying a list of pairwise
automorphisms between the DNA sequences from the MSA of primate BRCA1
DNA repair gene. The data set brca1_aln2 has 41 DNA sequences and it
contains the previous 20 primate variants found in 'braca1_aln' data set
plus 21 single mutation variants (SMV) from the human sequence NM_007298
transcript variant 4. The location of each SMV is given in the heading from
each sequence.
}
\details{
The automorphisms were estimated from the \code{\link{brca1_aln}} MSA with
function \code{\link{autZ64}}.
