data("brca1_autm2", package = "GenomAutomorphism")
}
\description{
This is a \link{AutomorphismList} object carrying a list of pairwise
automorphisms between the DNA sequences from the MSA of primate BRCA1
DNA repair gene. The data set brca1_aln2 has 41 DNA sequences and it
contains the previous 20 primate variants found in 'braca1_aln' data set
plus 21 single mutation variants (SMV) from the human sequence NM_007298
transcript variant 4. The location of each SMV is given in the heading from
each sequence. The automorphisms were estimated from the \link{brca1_aln} MSA
with function \link{autZ64}.
