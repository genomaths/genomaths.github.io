\description{
This is a \code{\link[Biostrings]{DNAMultipleAlignment}} carrying a MSA of
\href{https://bit.ly/3DimROD}{BRCA1 DNA repair genes} to be used in the
examples provided for the package functions. The original file can be
downloaded from GitHub at: \url{https://bit.ly/3DimROD}. This data set has
41 DNA sequences and it contains the previous 20 primate variants found in
'brca1_aln' data set plus 21 single mutation variants (SMV) from the human
sequence NM_007298 transcript variant 4. The location of each SMV is given
in the heading from each sequence.
