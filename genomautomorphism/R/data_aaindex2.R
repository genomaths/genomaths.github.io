#' List of 94 Amino Acid Matrices from AAindex
#'
#' The aminoacid similarity matrices from Amino Acid Index Database
#' \url{https://www.genome.jp/aaindex/} are provided here. AAindex (ver.9.2) 
#' is a database of numerical indices representing various physicochemical and
#' biochemical properties of amino acids and pairs of amino acids.
#'
#' The similarity of amino acids can be represented numerically, expressed in
#' terms of observed mutation rate or physicochemical properties. A similarity
#' matrix, also called a mutation matrix, is a set of 210 numerical values, 20
#' diagonal and 20x19/2 off-diagonal elements, used for sequence alignments 
#' and similarity searches.
#' 
#' @seealso \code{\link{aaindex2}} and \code{\link{aa_mutmat}}, and
#' \code{\link{get_mutscore}}.
