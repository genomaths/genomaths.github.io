This zip file carries the genome browser methylation tracks (in WIG format) suplied as supporting material for the article:

Sanchez, Robersy, and Sally A Mackenzie. “Integrative Network Analysis of Differentially Methylated 
and Expressed Genes for Biomarker Identification in Leukemia.” Scientific Reports 10, no. 1 (2020)

The Integrated Genome Browser (IGB, https://bioviz.org) was used visualization for genome-scale data reported in Fig. 7 and 8
The genomic coordinates correspond to the following human genome reference from 2009, as detailed below:

H_sapiens_Feb_2009
Human_Feb_2009
hs.NCBIv37
hg19
human_ncbi37
ncbi.v37
hs:Feb_2009
Hs:Feb_2009
hs:NCBIv37
Hs:NCBIv37
chado/chado-Hsa-19
human/19
Hs;NCBIv37
Hs:NCBI37
GRCh37
Hs:GRCh37
Homo_sapiens.GRCh37.reference

The scores visualized in the IGB correspond to the average of methylation level differences.
By construction/definition, this magnitude in information theory is known as total variation distance (TV).
